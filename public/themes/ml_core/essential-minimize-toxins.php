                <p>
                    Minimizing exposure and clearing the toxins from your body resets your body’s natural balance and
                    allows it to function at its fullest potential. This starts with guidance on the lifestyle choices
                    needed to reduce the toxins entering your system. We’ll also provide you with the dietary
                    guidelines, supplements, and care needed to boost your body’s own inherent cleansing powers,
                    allowing you to detox&nbsp;and&nbsp;thrive.

                            Detoxification is both the body’s first and last line of defense against dangerous toxins
                            that we come into contact with daily. The 5 Essentials drive detoxification by helping the
                            body remove toxins that are already present in the body, while also promoting new lifestyle
                            habits that can reduce exposure in the future. While we can’t completely control our
                            environment, being aware of what we encounter and modifying how and what we consume can
                            greatly reduce exposure. MaxLiving believes that optimal health depends on resetting your
                            body back to its natural balance – helping it detoxify itself is vitally important.

                            Our three-step plan drives detoxification in two important ways, working at the cellular and
                            organ level. While many detox plans focus on organs like the colon, many of the most harmful
                            toxins accumulate at the cellular level and must be effectively cleared to avoid long-term
                            damage.

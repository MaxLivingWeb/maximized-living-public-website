            MaxLiving is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular,
            we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive
            from this Web site.
        </p>
        <h2>Information Collected</h2>
        <p>
            In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about
            yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web
            servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a &quot;cookie&quot; (a small data file) on your computer&#39;s hard
            drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical
            information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site, and to MaxLiving promotions
            on other sites. This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information
            that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the
            effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than MaxLiving
            affiliates and contractors who assist MaxLiving in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality.
            However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you
            before one is placed.
            <br><br>
            In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personal information from
            you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information you request. The information
            collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address. For
            electronic access to annual reports and proxy statements, we collect your tax identification number to
            verify your shareholder status. For our supplier diversity site, we necessarily collect information about
            gender and ethnicity, such as whether your business is female-owned.
            <br><br>
            This Web site is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect
            personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services
            to children.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Collected Information</h2>
        <p>
            Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is
            aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use
            this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.
            <br><br>
            When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let
            you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the
            personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your request (such as to
            receive electronic annual reports or to be added to our supplier diversity database). This information
            <br><br>
            may be shared with other Maximized Living businesses, but only if necessary to fulfill your request or for
            related purposes.
            <br><br>
            We may share the personal information you provide with other companies we have hired to provide
            services for us. These companies - our vendors - are contractually bound to use personal information we
            share with them only to perform the services we have hired them to provide. We do not share, sell, or
            lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release
            information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally
            limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud).
            <br><br>
            If you register with one of Maximized Living business units online, they may use this information to
            provide you with custom information about MaxLiving offerings in support of your business needs. They
            may also seek to place a &quot;cookie&quot; (small data file) as discussed above in order to provide you with
            tailored information. You should review the privacy policy associated with that Maximized Living
            business&#39; Web site for further information about that Maximized Living business&#39; privacy practices.

        <p>
            MaxLiving web site may contain links to other sites such as MaxLiving distributors and sales affiliates.
            While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not

        <h2>Security of Collected Information</h2>

            We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal
            information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to
            those MaxLiving workers who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request.
            Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.

        <h2>Phishing / Fraudulent Transactions</h2>
        <p>
            Internet fraudsters and scam artists are increasingly targeting unsuspecting people by a method called
            PHISHING. This involves illegitimate third parties using the name of legitimate companies like MaxLiving
            to obtain private information from online customers, such as financial details (e.g. credit card numbers
            or passwords). This practice is carried out either by sending a phony e-mail directed to the victims or by
            directing them to a website where information is requested. Please be aware that this unscrupulous
            people may suggest that bad things will happen if you do not immediately provide or verify your
            financial information.
        </p>

        <h3>How to protect yourself from such scams:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                MaxLiving&#39;s official communications are never sent from personal email addresses hosted on domains
                such as yahoo, hotmail, gmail etc. Please verify the sender email address carefully.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are unsure whether a contact is legitimate, go to the companyâ€™s web site by typing in the site
                address or using a page you have previously book marked, instead of using a link provided by the e-mail.
            </li>
            <li>
                Please treat any notification of having to login to your account via email or to go to another site to
                login with extreme caution.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What to do if you suspect a phishing email:</h3>
        <p>
            Do not reply.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not open any attachments. Attachments may contain malicious code that will infect your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Do not click on any links included in the email.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you still feel it is a phishing / scam email, please forward the suspect email to
            abuse@maxliving.com for us to take necessary action. Alternately, you may report it immediately
            to our helpline at <a href="tel:3219393030" data-phone class="phoneNumberAW">(321) 939-3030</a>.

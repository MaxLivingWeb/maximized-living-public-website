            <h3>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
            <p>
                This TOS constitutes the entire agreement between you and Maximized Living
                and shall govern the use of our Services, superseding any prior version of this
                <br><br>
                TOS between you and us with respect to Maximized Living Services. You may
                also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use

                party content or third-party software.
            </p>

            <h3>CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM</h3>
            <p>
                It is at the mutual agreement of both you and Maximized Living with regard to the
                TOS that the relationship between the parties shall be governed by the laws of
                the state of Florida without regard to its conflict of law provisions and that any
                and all claims, causes of action and/or disputes, arising out of or relating to the
                TOS, or the relationship between you and Maximized Living, shall be filed within
                the courts having jurisdiction within the County of Osceola, Florida or the U.S.
                District Court located in said state. You and Maximized Living agree to submit to
                the jurisdiction of the courts as previously mentioned, and agree to waive any
                and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts
                and to venue in such courts.
            </p>

            <h3>WAIVER AND SEVERABILITY OF TERMS</h3>
            <p>
                At any time, should Maximized Living fail to exercise or enforce any right or
                provision of the TOS, such failure shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
                provision. If any provision of this TOS is found by a court of competent
                jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
                endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and
                the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and effect.
            </p>

            <h3>STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</h3>
            <p>
                You acknowledge, understand and agree that regardless of any statute or law to
                the contrary, any claim or action arising out of or related to the use of our
                Services or the TOS must be filed within year(s) after said claim or cause of
                action arose or shall be forever barred.
